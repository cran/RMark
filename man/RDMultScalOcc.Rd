# Study design and data structure:
# two sessions (i.e., seasons) and 346 sampling sites
# up to three secondary sampling periods per season
# up to three survey devices per sampling site

# import the sample data, RDMultScalOcc.sampledata.csv
pathtodata=paste(path.package("RMark"),"extdata",sep="/")
dt=read.csv(paste(pathtodata,"RDMultScalOcc.sampledata.csv",sep="/"))
dt[is.na(dt)]=0 # replace NAs with 0
dt$ch=as.character(dt$ch) # encounter histories (dt$ch) must be characters

# note: habitat variables (amount of open forest and average slope) were collected at
# two spatial scales
# 'sOpen' and 'sSlope' represent the entire sampling site
# 'pOpen##' and 'pSlope##' represent conditions relevant to individual devices 
# at each sampling period
# the p-scale variables are coded [name][session][primary]; 
# dt.ddl$p$primary indicates how this should be entered
# in this case the values for p$primary varied among devices and between sessions, 
# but were constant between secondary sampling periods

# create the Process Data MARK object
