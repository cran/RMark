\usage{
\method{print}{mark}(x,...,input=FALSE)
       \method{print}{marklist}(x,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{mark model object; or list of mark model objects created with
\code{\link{collect.models}}}

\item{...}{additional non-specified argument for S3 generic function}

\item{input}{if TRUE, prints mark input file; otherwise the output file}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
If print is for a mark model, it displays MARK output file or input file
with MarkViewer (notepad.exe by default) so it can be viewed. If print is
for a marklist, it displays the model.table if it exists. To display the
output for a mark model contained in a list, simply type the list value
(e.g., typing mymarklist[[2]] will display output for the second model).
The function \code{print.marklist} was created to avoid accidental typing of
the model list which would call \code{print.mark} for each of the models.
}
\details{
If the model has been run (\code{model$output} exists) the output file
stored in the directory as identified by the basefile name
(\code{model$output}) and the suffix ".out" is displayed with a call to
\code{MarkViewer}. If \code{input} is set to \code{TRUE} then the MARK input
file is displayed instead. By default the \code{MarkViewer} is notepad but
any program can be used in its place that accepts the filename as the first
argument. For example setting \code{MarkViewer="wp"} will use wordperfect
(wp.exe) as long as wp.exe is in the search path.  \code{MarkViewer} must be
set during each R session, so it is best to include it in your \code{.First}
function to change it permanently.  Since \code{print.mark} is the generic
function to print \code{mark} objects you can use it by just typing the name
of a \code{mark} object at the R prompt and it will call \code{print.mark}.
For example, if \code{mod} is a \code{mark} object then typing \code{mod} is
the same as \code{print.mark(mod)}
